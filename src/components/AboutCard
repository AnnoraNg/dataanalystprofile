        <p>
          I'm a marketing analyst with a foundation in digital campaigns and growing expertise in data analytics. 
          I enjoy solving business problems with SQL, Python, and Tableau, and translating user behaviour into data-backed insights. 
          I'm especially interested in roles that blend marketing strategy with analytics.
